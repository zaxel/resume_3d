# 3D Resume (JS, Three.js)

A virtual 3D resume built with JavaScript, designed as an interactive game where a character explores a limited-size map. 
By visiting different structures, users unlock various resume sections.

*************************************************
### ***Key Features:***
- **Fully JavaScript-based** – Built entirely with JavaScript, using **Three.js** and other **supporting libraries**.
- **Character and World Physics** – Uses **Rapier.js** for colliders and realistic interactions.
- **Low-poly Game Map** – Features detailed 3D objects and structures representing different CV chapters.
- **Character Controller** – Realistic movement, jumping, and running using a state machine-based approach.
- **Procedural Grass System** – Grass behaves naturally using Perlin noise and is generated only in allowed areas based on topology calculations.
- **Curious little chicks** – Funny little chicks that explore and follow you once you're in their habitat near the **blacksmith’s house**.
- **Realistic Water Simulation** – A flowing river with directional water flow, using modified shaders in Three.js Water2 to fit the map’s height and allowed areas.
- **Dynamic Fog System** – Enhanced Three.js fog, with Perlin noise-driven movement, height-based density, and realistic depth effects.
- **Procedural Vegetation** – Trees, stumps, and stones are randomly placed based on a growth map and height calculations.
- **Interactive Book UI** – The CV is presented as a realistic 3D book, allowing users to open, rotate, zoom, and turn pages with bending effects.
- **Immersive Sound Design** – Includes page-turning sounds, river flow, wind, and background music for added realism.
- And much more...

*************************************************
### ***Tech Stack:***
- **JavaScript (JS)** – Main programming language.
- **GLSL** – Used for shader programming.
- **Three.js** – Core 3D rendering library.
- **Rapier.js** – Physics engine for collisions and interactions.
- **Blender & GIMP** – For 3D modeling, textures, and graphical assets.
- **Various utilities** – For additional pre/post-processing of assets.
